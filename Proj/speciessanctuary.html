       <p1 class="overlap">A wide variety of the planet's animal species call the Philippines home. 
           Conservation International, a nonprofit environmentalist group founded in 1987, recognizes 
           the Philippines as one of only 17 mega-diverse countries worldwide. Mega-diverse countries 
           are nations that shelter the bulk of Earth's animal and plant life. In other words, these countries 
           have extreme biodiversity in terms of genetic, genus, and bio-network mixtures.</br>
        </br>
        With so much biological diversity, the country is also home to many threatened animal species. As of the day this article was published,
         the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) had declared 418 animal species in the Philippines 
         to be threatened: meaning they are either vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered, according to the IUCN red list criteria.
